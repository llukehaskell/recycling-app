There are a two main reasons why cat litter belongs in the garbage cart: 1. Risk of chemical contamination. Cat litters often contain chemicals to mask odours, and these can be harmful to the Citys composting process.  2. Risk of pathogen contamination. Cat waste can also carry pathogens. Most pathogens are destroyed during compost processing. However, a parasite called toxoplasma is commonly found in cat feces, and it cannot be reliably destroyed by standard processing. Toxoplasma is not found in dog feces, which is why unbagged dog waste is still allowed in the food scraps cart. We return the finished compost to Edmontonians so it needs to be safe for all residential uses, including on edible plants. That means it&rsquo;s important that no harmful substances are present in the finished compost."
